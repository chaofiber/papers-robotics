### Summary

- This paper uses CNN to predict the position of the foothold of the robot. It increases the infer speed in planning the foothold, compared to a more traditional way, and also it achieved better guarantee because CNN has better robustness compared to the heuristic criteria.

### Analysis
- The performance matrix of the CNN is by minimizing the loss between the predicted one-hot local matrix and the 0-1 heuristic matrix.
  - For a local map centered at the foothold, it extracts an elevation map around it, and the heuristic matrix assign each cell a binary value such that we know this is safe or not. This heuristic can be naively chosen, and because the elevation map is quite noisy, so simply based on this might lead to failure.
  - The CNN is pretrained, and after training the CNN, the main motion generation and control part is still done on a usual manner.
### Thoughts
- The height map actually has knowledge about the foot position, it centers at the prediction foothold (which can be generated by other ways).
- In this paper, the output of the CNN has a physical meaning (by minimizing the loss). Can we actually use this idea, and simply get a desired foothold and then form the desired trajectory, and let the MPC-net track it?
