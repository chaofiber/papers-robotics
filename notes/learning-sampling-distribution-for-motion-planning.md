### Summary

- This paper proposes a methodology to sample non-uniformly by giving a successful demonstration more weights. It should be able to favour the plannings that lie in the region that most likely a successful optimal trajectory should exist. This idea is achieved by sampling from a latent feature (which should be the embedding of the successful demonstration), because of the nature of the Gaussian distribution, such sampling method bias the successful demonstration. 
- The framework is so-called conditional variational autoencoder. The idea should be able to be applied on any path-planning problems that requires a sampling method.
